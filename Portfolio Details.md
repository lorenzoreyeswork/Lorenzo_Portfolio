**Project 1: Sustatinable Development Goal 2: World Hunger Dataset**

This is a project I have accomplished for my certificate of completion for DataSense Analytics Professional Power BI. 
In order to have a niche in healthcare analytics, I decided to use datasets that are familiar to me.

In this dataset, I managed to determine the trends of countries prevalent to malnutrition among children under 5 years old.

Procedure:
1. Data was obtained through Kaggle. [World Hunger DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/the-global-hunger-index)
2. .csv Files was first skimmed, and opened in Power BI.
3. Each CSV files were transformed then loaded individually.
4. Each files were checked for errors, duplicates, and observed for similarities in columns which would be essential for data validation
5. Prevalence of each malnutrition categorical values were interpretted through conditional formatting by: Low, Moderate, Serious, Alarming, Very Alarming.
6. Data Modeling was then established.
7. Trends were determined, then dashboard was created.
